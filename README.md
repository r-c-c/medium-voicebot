# medium-voicebot

It is a Voice Chatbot app to practice German language skills.

It takes voice input in german from user.

Bot generates response via blenderbot as text.

After that, app sends the audio version of text in german. 

Deployed via Gradio.

I use google API based libraries for speech recognition (speech to text), text to speech, and language translation.
