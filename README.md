# Business Problem

<br>• Many people struggle to practice and improve their speaking skills in a second language, due to a lack of opportunities to use the language in real-world situations or to interact with native speakers.
<br>• It provides a way for language learners to practice their speaking skills by engaging in conversation with an AI chatbot that is designed to mimic human conversation.

# Tools Used

• gradio (web app)
<br>• transformers (chatbot model)
<br>• huggingface spaces (to host my app)
<br>• mtranslate (translator)
<br>• gtts (text to speech)
<br>• speech_recognition (speech to text)
<br>• bytes like objects for autoplaying audion on web

I use google API based libraries for speech recognition (speech to text), text to speech, and language translation.
